If we were more confident that [], we would focus on [] because [].
We have two competing theories about whether []. The first theory is that []. The second theory is that []. To make progress with reconciling these two theories we would need to demonstrate that []. 
To even know where to start, we would need to better understand [].
There are a couple paths we could take here. We could [], or[], or[]. Deciding between these three paths is difficult because we are unclear about [].
I’m curious about[]. I’m sure it seems unrelated to [], but for some reason I’m drawn to figuring out []. 
We’re all assuming the happy path -- that [] leads to [] (repeating). But what if we learned that instead [] ? How would we respond?
If we can’t determine whether [],it is truly an “all bets are off” situation.
In the near term, I think we’re fine with the decision to []. But in the mid to longer term I worry about [] because []. If we observe [] that will be an early signal that we need to [].
I see the key risk here being less about [] and more about []. For the former, we currently know []. For the latter, we’re unsure about [] and that is important because [].
We run the risk of prematurely converging around [] , and failing to converge on []. The impact of the former might be []. And the impact of the latter might be [].
That [] is the right answer for now, but I think we’ll need to revisit this in a couple months and explore [].
It is probably OK for us to delay figuring out [], but we’ll need to address this issue eventually. 
A year ago we were sure that []. Now, we’re less sure because []. 
We really are experts in [], but that doesn’t necessarily mean we are experts in []. To gain that expertise we would need to []. 
We’ve always assumed that learning more about [] was going to be too expensive and time consuming. What if that changed? Might we decide to [] ?
We may be over-confident in our ability to []. It hasn’t really been a problem yet because [], but it could become a problem in the future if [].
I’m OK that we are less clear about []. We can change course there easily assuming []. But I’m less confident about our ability to change course when it comes to [].
We are getting a lot of conflicting information about []. This tells me that []. Perhaps we are asking the wrong question. What if instead we asked []?
The weakest link in our mental model is []. If we’re off -- even by a little -- it could have a big impact on this initiative because [].
I’d need to see more evidence of [] before feeling comfortable about our plan to [].
A danger of not resolving [] now is that we will eventually [].
Though highly improbable, if suddenly we learned that [] it would have a dramatic impact on how we are approaching this challenge.
The key factor in this decision is my belief that []. I may be biased, though, in that I believe that []. To play devil's advocate, what if [] ?
We’re placing a lot of emphasis on the question of whether [] -- which is good. But we do run the risk of over-indexing on [] and missing the question of whether [].
We seem to be treating [] as a foregone conclusion. I’m not sure it is that simple. If we were proven wrong (or less right) about [], it would impact us in the following ways: [] .
At the moment, I’m not sure whether we are dealing with a [] or with a [] . It is unclear. To narrow the problem down, we need to learn more about [] .
Our current strategy hinges on our ability to [] while [] . If we learned that [], it would likely cause us to shift our approach from [] to [] .
The signals point to [] , but to really make a case for [], we would need to see more evidence of [] . 
At the moment we are juggling lots of constraints including [] . If we could remove the constraint to [], that would allow us to [] . To remove that constraint we would need to explore whether[].
